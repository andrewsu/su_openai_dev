{"organismal entity": "A named entity that is either a part of an organism, a whole organism, population or clade of organisms, excluding molecular entities", "disease or phenotypic feature": "Either one of a disease or an individual phenotypic feature. Some knowledge resources such as Monarch treat these as distinct, others such as MESH conflate.", "exposure event": "A feature of the environment of an organism that influences one or more phenotypic features of that organism, potentially mediated by genes", "molecular entity": "A gene, gene product, small molecule or macromolecule (including protein complex)", "chemical substance": "May be a chemical entity or a formulation with a chemical entity as active ingredient, or a complex material with multiple chemical entities as part", "drug": "A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease", "metabolite": "Any intermediate or product resulting from metabolism. Includes primary and secondary metabolites.", "genomic entity": "an entity that can either be directly located on a genome (gene, transcript, exon, regulatory region) or is encoded in a genome (protein)", "genome": "A genome is the sum of genetic material within a cell or virion.", "transcript": "An RNA synthesized on a DNA or RNA template by an RNA polymerase", "exon": "A region of the transcript sequence within a gene which is not removed from the primary RNA transcript by RNA splicing", "macromolecular machine": "A union of gene, gene product, and macromolecular complex. These are the basic units of function in a cell. They either carry out individual biological activities, or they encode molecules which do this.", "gene product": "The functional molecular product of a single gene. Gene products are either proteins or functional RNA molecules", "protein": "A gene product that is composed of a chain of amino acid sequences and is produced by ribosome-mediated translation of mRNA", "gene product isoform": "This is an abstract class that can be mixed in with different kinds of gene products to indicate that the gene product is intended to represent a specific isoform rather than a canonical or reference or generic product. The designation of canonical or reference may be arbitrary, or it may represent the superclass of all isoforms.", "protein isoform": "Represents a protein that is a specific isoform of the canonical or reference protein. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114032/", "gene family": "any grouping of multiple genes or gene products related by common descent", "genotype": "An information content entity that describes a genome by specifying the total variation in genomic sequence and/or gene expression, relative to some extablished background", "haplotype": "A set of zero or more Alleles on a single instance of a Sequence[VMC]", "sequence variant": "An allele that varies in its sequence from what is considered the reference allele at that locus.", "anatomical entity to anatomical entity part of association": "A relationship between two anatomical entities where the relationship is mereological, i.e the two entities are related by parthood. This includes relationships between cellular components and cells, between cells and tissues, tissues and whole organisms", "anatomical entity to anatomical entity ontogenic association": "A relationship between two anatomical entities where the relationship is ontogenic, i.e the two entities are related by development. A number of different relationship types can be used to specify the precise nature of the relationship", "biological process or activity": "Either an individual molecular activity, or a collection of causally connected molecular activities", "molecular activity": "An execution of a molecular function carried out by a gene product or macromolecular complex.", "biological process": "One or more causally connected executions of molecular functions", "cellular component": "A location in or around a cell"}
